# [BME 370] Capstone - Muscle Strain Monitoring Device for Heel & Feet

### Objective:  
The goal of this project is to make an app that serves as an interface between an Arduino Nano 33 IoT and IOS devices. Our physical device uses an Arduino Nano 33 IoT and a variety of sensors to calculate muscle strain in the feet and heels. These measurements are sent to this app via bluetooth. The app should
